That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. She calls it a Mayonegg. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. If I wanted something your thumb touched I'd eat the inside of your ear.<br><br>I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. A million [bleep]ing diamonds!
